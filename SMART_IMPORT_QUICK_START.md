## 📖 How to Use

### Basic Workflow

1. **Upload Question Paper** (PDF/Image)
2. **Questions Extracted Automatically**
3. **Review in Preview Modal**
4. **Assign Marks** (1-5 per question)
5. **Edit Questions** (with math support)
6. **Save to Question Bank**

### Editing Questions with Math

#### Simple Input
Just type naturally - we handle the formatting:

```
Input:  (x+2/3) + sqrt(y)
Output: $\frac{x+2}{3} + \sqrt{y}$

Input:  x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0
Output: $x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0$

Input:  d/dx (sin(x)) = cos(x)
Output: $\frac{d}{dx}(\sin(x)) = \cos(x)$
```

#### Quick Reference
Click **"📚 Math Input Quick Reference"** in the editor for:
- Fractions: `(a/b)`
- Roots: `sqrt(x)` or `nthroot(x)`
- Powers: `x^2` or `x^{10}`
- Greek: `alpha`, `beta`, `pi`, `theta`
- Operators: `×`, `÷`, `±`, `≤`, `≥`

#### Live Preview
As you type, see the formatted output in the **green preview box** below the editor.

## 🧪 Testing the Improvements

### Test 1: State Persistence
1. Upload a question paper
2. Wait for extraction
3. **Close the modal** (don't save)
4. **Reopen the modal**
5. ✅ Questions should still be there!

### Test 2: Math Editing
1. Click "Edit" on any question
2. Type: `The formula is (a+b/c) + sqrt(x^2 + y^2)`
3. ✅ See live preview below
4. Click "Done"
5. ✅ Math renders beautifully

### Test 3: Complex Equations (Class 8-10)
Try these in the editor:

**Algebra:**
```
x^2 - y^2 = (x+y)(x-y)
```

**Factorization:**
```
a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = (a+b)^2
```

**Fractions:**
```
((x+1)/(x-1)) + ((y+2)/(y-2))
```

**Calculus:**
```
lim x -> ∞ (1/(x^2)) = 0
```

- Use common symbols: `>=`, `<=`, `pi`
- No need to remember complex LaTeX

### 4. Use the Quick Reference
- Click the expandable reference guide
- See examples while you type
- Copy patterns that match your needs

### 5. Check the Live Preview
- Preview updates in real-time
- Catch formatting errors early
- See exactly what students will see

### 6. Edit MCQ Options Too
- All option fields support math
- Each option has its own preview
- Format answers beautifully

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Preview doesn't match my input"
**Solution:** Check the quick reference - some patterns need specific formatting:
- Use parentheses for fractions: `(a/b)` not `a/b`
- Use `sqrt(x)` not `√x`
- Powers need `^`: `x^2` not `x2`

### Issue: "Greek letters not showing"
**Solution:** Type the full name: `alpha`, `beta`, `theta`, `pi`, etc.

### Issue: "Lost my edits when I closed modal"
**Solution:** This is fixed! But if you see this:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Ensure JavaScript is enabled
3. Try a different browser

### Issue: "Math looks wrong in saved questions"
**Solution:** 
1. Click "Edit" to review
2. Check the live preview
3. Adjust and save again

## 📚 Examples for Classes 8-10

### Class 8: Basic Algebra
```
Solve: (x+5/3) = (2x-1/4)
```

### Class 9: Factorization
```
Factorize: x^2 + 5x + 6
Answer: (x+2)(x+3)
```

### Class 10: Quadratic Equations
```
Solve using formula: ax^2 + bx + c = 0
x = ((−b ± sqrt(b^2 − 4ac))/(2a))
```

### Class 11: Calculus
```
Find d/dx of x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x + 4
```

### Class 12: Integration
```
Evaluate: int (sin(2x)) dx
```
